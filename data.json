My first question was to ask it about a medical pharma issue facing my Dad. The results confirmed what had taken me days to read up on,in seconds. The only challenge (as with everything) refining the question. What a game changer. It feels like we are at a fork in the road. There is the past/establishment with a bureaucracy of those who hold/withold information, and the present where the deconstruction of power, availability of open access and holding folk to account could change everything.

If i tell you my age you may say , ahh. But at 86 yrs with 60yrs IT it has arrived at the best time, at the most precious time and Grok is solving all my concerns re handling communication and  modern understanding,\nJust dont trust it first hand, challenge and question like in  any other conversation and you will be impressed by the professionalism that results.

It’s actually challenging the questions I’m asking where ChatGTP seems to always give you an answer (which can be wrong sometime - Grok too)\nHowever the buzz killer for me is the total lack of MEMORY with Grok. It makes the whole thing no useable for me. There’s no way I’m going to re explain what my business do everytime I need to ask something specific. \nThis and the fact that Grok can’t read pictures is also a massive issue. On gtp I upload a photos and ask question about it (like ‘where’s the pump on the boiler’). Grok can’t read photos or documents. BIG downer. I how they’ll fix those really soon (but according to Grok memory won’t be for a few month and reading pictures likely not this year so….)\nI won’t be moving over to a paid version until this is done.",

The information they provide is a breath of fresh air from the ones produced by Chat Gpt, and there’s no limits to memory saving, you don’t have to spend a single penny for it compared to Chat gpt where they only allow you to save a certain amount of memory, and you can send Grok unlimited pictures to them without paying which is also very good. \n\nHowever, then there are the problems. Big problems. At certain points in a message tab, Grok becomes unusable. It pretty much shut downs and forgets all your memory from a specific message tab you’ve had opened and it takes ages for it to reply to your messages and sometimes even deletes them. \n\nThen there is the UI. The UI is terrible. Glitchy, slow and time consuming. Chat GPT is 100% better in this aspect. And I often started using Chat GPT again over Grok because it was more convenient and less time consuming and ZERO lag. \n\nThe UI is the worst aspect of Grok and needs fixing asap. And I’ve moved back to using Chat GPT instead simply because it is easier , more convenient, quicker, less time consuming and no lag. \n\nI probably will come back to using Grok at some point in the near future. But right now it is simply far inferior to Chat GPT. \n\nGrok does have the potential to take that place though. It just needs more work, such as better UI, and quicker responses.",

Good at retrieving simple data by scouring the Internet but it misses sometimes fundamental things.\n.\nExamples:\nRecipes. I asked for a Brazilian frosting recipe with heavy cream and condensed milk. It came out with lots of stuff totally irrelevant and I had to prod it and ask for frosting for cupcakes to get actually some info that would be correct.\n\nI asked about tax in France. Oh boy.\nIt was complex stuff but still. Not good.\n\nThen I  asked about my MMO video-game and my character set up and what it would recommend ( magicka sorcerer one bar) and it was so wrong it was actually funny. If I ran my toon with that set up I would not last 5 minutes. \nSo in conclusion, if you  are after simple info, it will scour the Internet, kind of summarise it and return à wall of information. Most of it totally irrelevant, but eventually after 500 pages you will get your two sentences response. \nFor slightly more complex or subtle stuff.... no chance. \nI will move on to another AI see if I can find the I in AI. \n\nMy concern is that it will use private websites that do the hard work to copy and return data.

          "label": "Elon Musk has touted Grok 3 AI as a groundbreaking advancement in artificial intelligence, supposedly capable of rivaling the best in the industry. However, after testing it firsthand, it’s clear that Grok 3 is nothing more than an overhyped, mediocre chatbot with fundamental flaws that expose its limitations.\n\nFor a system that was expected to challenge GPT-4 and other leading AI models, Grok 3 falls embarrassingly short. It struggles with basic reasoning, frequently generates incorrect or misleading information, and lacks the depth and nuance that true intelligence requires. Its so-called “wit” feels forced, its answers are often shallow, and its supposed “understanding” of complex topics is riddled with errors.\n\nDespite Musk’s grand claims, Grok 3 is neither revolutionary nor impressive—it’s just another AI model pretending to be smarter than it actually is. If this is what passes as cutting-edge AI under Musk’s vision, then perhaps it’s time to stop taking his tech predictions seriously.\n\nAt the end of the day, Grok 3 is not the future—it’s just another overmarketed gimmick that fails to live up to its hype.",
